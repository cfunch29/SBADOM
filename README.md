Creating a simple landing page for launching new site

- I decided to add a countdown feature

### Reflection
---

- there is an error in my console for a chrome extension, I can't figure out how to fix it 
"contentScript.bundle.js:1  GET chrome-extension://pbanhockgagggenencehbnadejlgchfc/assets/userReportLinkedCandidate.json net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND" 

- also a terminal error that it's not pulling node script. but if I change directories inside terminal it runs. I never had this issue before. I tried updating/restarting VS but the error still exists.
"node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1424
  throw err;
