# SBA - DOM
## 
Creating a simple landing page for launching new site 
- I chose this simple project because small businesses are always looking for websites and this is a porfolio starter kit essential!
- Add alert for coming soon
- I decided to add a countdown feature

### Reflection
---
1. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

- the parent/child/sibling relationship was difficult for me. I need to study and practice more

2. What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

- I would have added more to the DOM event form 

## Errors
- there is an error in my console for a chrome extension, I can't figure out how to fix it 
"contentScript.bundle.js:1  GET chrome-extension://pbanhockgagggenencehbnadejlgchfc/assets/userReportLinkedCandidate.json net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND"
