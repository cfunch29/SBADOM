Creating a simple landing page for launching new site

### Reflection
---

- there is an error in my console for a chrome extension, I can't figure out how to fix it 
- also a terminal error that it's not pulling node script. but if I change directories inside terminal it runs. I never had this issue before. I tried updating/restarting VS but the error still exists.
